# dis-sport

Interactive map of charities in England that list their charitiable category as sport, disabilities or both in Charity Commission filings. Built by [Evan Odell](http://evanodell.com) for the [Get Yourself Active](http://www.getyourselfactive.org/) project at [Disability Rights UK](http://disabilityrightsuk.org). You can see an example of the map in action at [evanodell.shinyapps.io/dis-sport/](https://evanodell.shinyapps.io/dis-sport/).

For an introduction and step-by-step guide to creating this map for your own purposes, please see the [map making introduction](https://disabilityrightsuk.github.io/dis-sport/map-making). The introduction is intended for complete beginners to programming with R, and hopefully can be followed by programming novices. If you have any questions or comments about creating this map, its content, or need some assistance getting the whole thing set up, please [get in touch](mailto:evan.odell@disabilityrightsuk.org).
