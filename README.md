# dis-sport

Interactive map of charities in England that list their charitiable category as sport, disabilities or both in Charity Commission filings. Built for the [Get Yourself Active](http://www.getyourselfactive.org/) project at [Disability Rights UK](http://disabilityrightsuk.org). Available at https://shiny.evanodell.com/dis-sport/. Updated every month or so, or at least when I have time.
